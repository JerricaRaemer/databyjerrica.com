**Analysis:** Drug efficacy in mice

**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, statistical summaries, box plot)

**Scope:** 249 unique mice, each monitored over time for tumor growth

**Outcome:** Capomulin and Ramicane showed the most consistent tumor volume reductions

## Minimizing Strain on Systems

**Problem:** System Overload During Open Enrollment

**Tools:** Excel (AbleBits add-in), internal reporting

**Workflow Optimization:** Developed macro-based workflow to streamline uploads
