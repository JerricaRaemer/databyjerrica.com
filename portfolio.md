# Portfolio: Analytics In Action

> Welcome to my portfolio, where each example highlights how I combine technical tools with industry expertise to solve business-critical problems. I specialize in benefits and compliance data, but my analytical process is transferable to a wide range of organizational challenges.
> 

<br>

## Preventing Data Overload During Open Enrollment
> **Problem:** Uploading full employee census files during online open enrollment overwhelmed systems, leading to crashes and delays.
> 
> **Solution:** Used Excel and the AbleBits add-on to compare current vs. previous census files, flagging only necessary changes for upload. Developed a repeatable macro-based workflow to streamline reviews.
> 
> **Outcome:** Prevented system crashes, preserved data integrity, reduced manual review time, and protected OE timelines.
> 
> **Tools:** Excel, AbleBits, workflow optimization, delta analysis
> 

<br>

## Ensuring Accurate Benefit Configuration Before Go-Live
> **Problem:** Config errors during onboarding created risk for IRS/HIPAA noncompliance and delayed participant access.
> 
> **Solution:** Used SQL to audit platform records and Excel validation tools to check eligibility rules across multiple platforms. Identified discrepancies, verified configuration, and built audit templates for future use.
> 
> **Outcome:** Delivered 100% of client configurations on time, fully compliant with regulatory standards, with seamless participant enrollment.
> 
> **Tools:** SQL, Excel (validation & cross-checking), platform configuration
> 

<br>

## Uncovering Trends in Claims, Appeals, and Forfeitures
> **Problem:** Participants repeatedly lost funds or faced claim denials due to unclear plan rules.
> 
> **Solution:** Used Python and Excel to analyze escalation logs by plan type, timing, and participant status. Identified patterns in forfeiture and appeal timing, then used findings to inform participant education materials.
> 
> **Outcome:** Reduced repeated errors, escalations, and support time. Enhanced participant education and improved internal handling of complex claims.
> 
> **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Excel, categorization & timing analysis
> 

<br>

## Boosting Participant Engagement with Smarter Communication
> **Problem:** High support volumes (1,300+ participant emails, 200+ calls/day) strained the Customer Service team.
> 
> **Solution:** Analyzed support logs to identify repeat issues and developed internal training materials, education templates, and external participant-facing content. Presented findings to leadership and proposed ongoing education meetings.
> 
> **Outcome:** Reduced repeat inquiries, increased participant confidence, strengthened internal consistency, and improved plan utilization.
> 
> **Tools:** Excel (log analysis), content creation, presentation decks, process design
> 

<br>

## SQL Data Management for Workforce Insights
> **Context:** Academic simulation of employee/department databases for workforce analytics.
> 
> **Technical Work:** Built schemas and queried relationships between employee, department, and salary tables. Used SQL joins, filters, and aggregations to extract trends such as hire dates, department managers, and top surnames.
> 
> **Tools:** SQL (PostgreSQL), schema design, multi-table queries, data exploration
> 

<br>

## Python APIs for Environmental Planning
> **Context:** Academic project demonstrating API integration, data cleaning, and visualization.
> 
> **Technical Work:** Queried Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap APIs to gather weather/location data, cleaned datasets using Pandas, stored API keys securely, and built visualizations for trend monitoring.
> 
> **Potential Use:** Supports operations and logistics planning by providing real-time geographic/weather data.
> 
> **Tools:** Python (requests, Pandas, Matplotlib), secure API handling
> 

<br>

## Drug Efficacy Study Using Python
> **Context:** Academic case study using real biological datasets to assess treatment outcomes.
> 
> **Technical Work:** Visualized tumor growth in mice across drug regimens. Used statistical tools to measure treatment effectiveness, identify outliers, and test significance.
> 
> **Potential Use:** Showcases ability to model and interpret health-related datasets in a rigorous analytical setting.
> 
> **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy), boxplots, correlation, regression
> 

<br>

## SQLAlchemy + Python Visualization
> **Context:** Combined SQL querying with Python-based visual storytelling.
> 
> **Technical Work:** Used SQLAlchemy to query relational databases, organized results in Pandas, and created visualizations to identify key trends.
> 
> **Tools:** SQLAlchemy, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), data pipeline integration
>
