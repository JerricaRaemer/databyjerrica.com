# Analytics In Action

> **These case studies showcase how I’ve used data to streamline workflows, improve accuracy, and protect timelines.**

## Case Study 1: Preventing Data Overload During Open Enrollment

### Situation:

> Large census files submitted by employers contained mostly redundant data. Uploading them as-is caused system crashes and slowed open enrollment timelines, which is especially problematic during high-volume enrollment periods.

### Solution:

> I developed a streamlined Excel workflow using AbleBits to compare incoming census data with existing records. The process isolated only the updated records, allowing for clean, efficient uploads without overloading internal systems.

### Outcome:

> * Eliminated hours of manual data review
>
> * Prevented upload errors and system crashes
>
> * Maintained participant data integrity and protected open enrollment timelines
> 

## Case Study 2: Ensuring Accurate Benefit Configuration Before Go-Live

### Situation:
> Client onboarding required flawless backend setup of pretax benefits, from eligibility rules to card configurations, under strict deadlines and legal compliance requirements.

### Solution:
> I managed setup across multiple platforms, using data validation, auditing, and SQL-driven queries to ensure clean configurations. I proactively identified gaps, verified every rule, and coordinated with internal teams to stay on track.

### Outcome:

> * Delivered 100% of client setups on time
>
> * Maintained IRS and HIPAA compliance standards
>
> * Enabled smooth enrollment experiences for tens of thousands of participants
> 

## Case Study 3: Uncovering Trends in Claims, Appeals, and Forfeitures
### Situation:
> Participants frequently misunderstood plan rules, resulting in lost funds, denied claims, and repeated escalations — especially during year-end or plan transitions.

### Solution:
> I categorized and analyzed high-volume case types using Excel and Python to identify trends by plan type, timing, and participant status. I partnered with compliance and communications teams to develop targeted guidance.

### Outcome:

> * Reduced preventable participant errors
>
> * Improved internal handling of complex cases
>
> * Enhanced participant education, saving time for both clients and service teams
>

## Case Study 4: Boosting Participant Engagement with Smarter Communication

### Situation:
> High support volume created strain on Customer Service team. We were receiving 1,300+ participant emails and 200 participant calls per employee per day. Analysis revealed this strain created ongoing confusion about eligibility, deadlines, and required documentation. This drained internal resources and lowered satisfaction.

### Solution:
> I analyzed support logs to identify frequent pain points, then developed streamlined education materials, templates, and training content to preempt common questions. I also presented my findings to upper management along with education materials for review. I presented a solution: Regular education meetings for our Customer Service team to address gaps identified in the data.
>
> At the time, these gaps were:
> * Who's elligible (ie: foster children, dependent parent, etc.);
> * What's elligible (ie: gym memberships, car window tinting, etc.);
> * Insurance process clarifications (ie: timelines, in-network vs out-of-network deductible expenses, EOB format familiarity across companies, etc.);
> * Tools to streamline processes (ie: MS Outlook Quick Parts for repeat inquiries).
> 
> I also implemented ongoing analysis for continuous learning and improvement.
> 

### Outcome:

> * Reduced repeat inquiries by addressing confusion up front
>
> * Increased participant confidence and plan utilization
>
> * Strengthened internal workflows and support consistency
