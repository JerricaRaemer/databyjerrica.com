## 💡 Reducing Support Volume by Fixing the Root Cause

> How participant education improved service outcomes and saved time
>
> High-volume support issues are often treated like a cost of doing business—but what if you could prevent the most common questions before they ever arise?
>
> In this post, I’ll walk through how analyzing participant support data led to meaningful improvements in communication, participant confidence, and team efficiency.

## The Problem: A Support System Under Pressure

> During peak enrollment periods, our Customer Service team faced overwhelming volume:
> 
> * 1,300+ participant emails per week
> 
> * 200+ calls per employer per day
> 
> Despite a fully staffed support center, we couldn’t keep up. Repetition was the norm—questions like:
>
> * “What’s covered under my benefit card?”
> 
> * “Why can’t I use funds for my spouse’s appointment?”
> 
> * “I didn’t know I had to submit a receipt—now what?”
> 
> These weren’t one-off issues. They were patterns.
> 

## The Analysis: Digging Into the Data

> Using Excel and case logs, I categorized support requests by:
>
> * Topic (eligibility, documentation, deadlines, etc.)
> 
> * Plan type (FSA, HSA, Commuter, etc.)
> 
> * Escalation tier
> 
> * Time of year
>

## From this, several patterns emerged

> Top Confusion Points:
>
> * Eligibility rules (who counts as a dependent)
>
> * Expense eligibility (why some things are reimbursed and others aren't)
>
> * Terminology mismatch (e.g., “prepaid benefit card” vs “debit card”)
>
> * Submission timing and documentation requirements
> 
> Impact:
>
> * Higher repeat calls
> 
> * Participant frustration
> 
> * Support team burnout
> 
> * Misuse or underuse of benefits
>   

## The Solution: Targeted, Ongoing Education

> Armed with data, I pitched a proactive education strategy to senior leadership. My proposal included:
> 
> * Internal Training: Regular education meetings for our Customer Service team focused on top confusion areas identified in the data.
> 
> * Resource Development: Clear, friendly templates for common participant questions.
> 
> * Participant Campaigns: Pre-OE emails and portal messages with visuals and plain-language tips, targeting the most misunderstood plan rules.
> 
> I also implemented ongoing ticket analysis to keep refining our messaging as participant behavior evolved.
> 

## The Results: Real, Measurable Impact

> After implementing the education plan:
>
> Fewer Repeat Inquiries
> 
> * *30% drop in duplicate questions within a single OE cycle.*
> 
> Improved Participant Confidence
>
> * *Survey feedback reflected clearer understanding of plan use, especially regarding card usage and dependent eligibility.*
> 
> Better Internal Support
>
> * *Fewer escalations meant more time for complex cases—and less burnout for the team.*

## Final Thought: Education Is a Compliance Strategy

> Clear communication isn’t fluff—it’s a risk mitigation tool. Preventable confusion wastes time, increases liability, and erodes trust.
>
> By using data to guide support content, we didn’t just reduce volume. We helped people use their benefits better.
>
> That’s good for participants, good for business—and very good for compliance.
