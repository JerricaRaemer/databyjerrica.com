# Reducing Preventable Participant Errors with Data

> *How behavioral analysis helped improve benefits education and reduce costly mistakes*
>
> Benefits plans are only as effective as the participants’ ability to use them. When participants don’t understand their plans, it doesn’t just impact them—it creates a ripple effect of support tickets, lost funds, and missed compliance opportunities.
>
> In this post, I’ll walk through how I used data to uncover trends in participant confusion—and transformed those insights into an education strategy that saved time, money, and frustration.

## The Problem: Repeat Escalations, Denied Claims, and Forfeitures

> Participants were consistently submitting claims for ineligible expenses or outside the eligible time period. This led to:
>
> * High rates of forfeiture (participants losing funds)
> 
> * Denied claims requiring manual appeals
> 
> * Frustrated participants escalating their issues
> 
> * Increased workload for Customer Service, Compliance, and Claims teams
> 
> Rather than handling these issues reactively, we decided to dig into the root causes.

## The Analysis: Finding the Patterns
> Using Excel and Python, I analyzed several months of cases flagged as “Participant Error.”
>
> Variables analyzed:
>
> * Plan type (HSA, FSA, DCA, etc.)
> 
> * Timing of the claim (e.g., before coverage start)
> 
> * Participant account status (active, terminated)
> 
> * Appeal outcomes
> 
> * Repeated escalations by the same individuals
>

## What We Discovered

> Some of the most common patterns included:
>
> * Misunderstanding of eligible expenses (especially dental vs. medical)
> 
> * Confusion about coverage periods after termination
> 
> * Repeated errors by participants who were never properly onboarded
> 
> * High volumes of claims submitted just after plan year rollover
> 
> We visualized this in Python using bar and pie charts to show:
>
> * Most common types of errors
> 
> * Percent of errors by plan type
> 
> * Number of escalations prevented after education intervention
>

# The Solution: Data-Driven Education

> We designed a multi-tiered education approach based on our findings:
>
> * Pre-enrollment emails highlighting top confusion areas
> 
> * Onboarding sessions focused on plan differences and timing
> 
> * Updated claim instructions with visual guides
> 
> * Short videos answering the “top 5” participant questions
> 
> * Monthly “learning labs” for internal support teams to strengthen their knowledge
>

## The Outcome

> * 40% reduction in repeat errors within one quarter
> 
> * Increase in successful claim submissions
> 
> * Fewer escalations to the Compliance team
> 
> * Improved participant satisfaction in post-interaction surveys
> 

## Key Takeaway: Education is a Compliance Tool
> Participant errors aren't just a nuisance; they’re a signal. By treating them as data points, you can design smarter education, streamline operations, and protect both your participants and your organization.
