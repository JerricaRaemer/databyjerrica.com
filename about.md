# My Story:

> I got into data because I’ve always been passionate about math, science, and the logic behind how things work.
>
> I have a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and a deep background in advanced math disciplines. I discovered early on that data is just numbers until you ask the right questions. I love turning raw data into meaningful insights that help organizations make smarter, faster, and more strategic decisions.
>
> My work focuses on using data the way it’s meant to be used: as a tool for clarity, not confusion. Whether I’m cleaning a dataset, running an analysis, or building a visual dashboard, I’m driven by the desire to turn complexity into simplicityand help businesses grow with less guesswork.
>
> When data becomes action, that’s when it becomes valuable. That’s where I come in.

## What Sets Me Apart:

#### Strategic Perspective

> When I analyze data, I'm looking for the story it’s telling and the *opportunities it reveals* with your big-picture goals in mind.
>
> Often, small and strategic changes make a BIG impact.

#### Commitment to Clarity

> Complex findings are only useful if everyone understands them. I pride myself on explaining analysis in plain language so teams at every level can act confidently.
> 

#### Quality, Accuracy, and Integrity

> From data cleaning to final presentation, I’m detail-oriented and meticulous. I believe great business decisions depend on clear data stories.
>
> I don't create the narrative from the data. I tell the story the data is already telling. The final product of my analyses is a data-accurate narrative that is presented clearly and easy to interpret.
> 

#### Business-Driven Results

> I measure success by the impact of my work. Whether it’s improving workflows, reducing waste, or growing revenue, I focus on tangible outcomes that help organizations thrive.
