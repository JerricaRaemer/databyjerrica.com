# My Story

I’m a lifelong math nerd with a passion for making data understood, actionable, and human-centered.

## Early Spark

I’ve loved math since I was seven, sometimes more than sleep. That curiosity and drive led to a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, complemented by extensive coursework in data analysis, coding, and statistics.

## Ongoing Passion

Today, I focus on using data the way it’s meant to be used: as a tool for clarity, not confusion.

## Human Impact

Early in my pretax benefits career, I realized that behind every enrollment form or payroll dataset, real lives are affected. That’s why my work prioritizes clarity, accuracy, and empathy.

## What Sets Me Apart

#### Strategic Perspective

Patterns in data reveal business opportunities. Every analysis is guided by your key business questions.

#### Commitment to Clarity

Complex findings only matter if everyone understands them. I pride myself on explaining analysis in plain language so teams at every level can act confidently.

#### Quality, Accuracy, and Integrity

I don't create the narrative from the data. I tell the story the data is already telling: A data-accurate narrative that is presented clearly and easy to interpret.

#### Business-Driven Results

I measure success by the impact of my work: Improving workflows, reducing waste, or growing revenue.
