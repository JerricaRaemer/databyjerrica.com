# Approach to Benefits Administration
### The heart behind my work
> I’m passionate about benefits because it is the intersection of humanity and livelihood. Benefits administration requires a balance of detailed, technical work and knowledge with empathy and compassion for the lived human experience. If I can help one person in my day navigate the complex world of benefits, I’m doing my job correctly. My goal for every participant is to help them fully utilize their benefits package in a way that best supports their specific living situation. This isn’t new territory for me; I understand what’s ahead and I’m prepared. I worked in pretax benefits administration for 6 years across two companies, each with their own interpretation of regulations and compliance. This experience taught me to be flexible, thorough, and curious.

### 🧠 My Benefits Philosophy in Practice
> Compliance is non-negotiable. But compliance doesn’t mean complexity (at least not for the participant). I work to bridge the gap between intricate regulations (IRS, HIPAA, EBIA, and more) and clear, accessible benefit experiences. Whether it’s explaining a denied claim, auditing eligibility, or navigating enrollment errors, I bring precision to the backend and clarity to the front end.

> I’ve worked hands-on with pretax plans including FSA (healthcare, dependent care), HRA, HSA, and commuter benefits. I understand how plan rules interact with real lives and how clean data, clear communication, and thoughtful workflows can make all the difference.
